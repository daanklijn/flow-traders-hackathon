# We won the 2019 Flow Traders Hackathon!

In May 2019 me and Felix won the Flow Traders Hackathon in The Netherlands. Our task was to develop a stock trading dashboard. We used this dashboard to trade stocks and earned a higher profit than the other teams that were competing. This eventually lead to us winning the competition.
